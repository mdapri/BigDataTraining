  <a data-rapid_p="4" name="intro"></a>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>MapReduce is a programming model designed for
  processing large volumes of data in parallel by
  dividing the work into a set of independent
  tasks. MapReduce programs are written in a particular
  style influenced by <i>functional programming</i>
  constructs, specifically idioms for processing
  lists of data. This module explains the nature of
  this programming model and how it can be used to
  write programs which run in the Hadoop environment.</p>

  <a data-rapid_p="5" name="goals"></a>
  <h3>Goals for this Module:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li class="bullist">Understand functional programming as it applies to MapReduce</li>
    <li class="bullist">Understand the MapReduce program flow</li>
    <li class="bullist">Understand how to write programs for Hadoop MapReduce</li>

    <li class="bullist">Learn about additional features of Hadoop designed to
        aid software development.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Prerequisites</h3>

  <p>This module requires that you have set up a build environment
  as described in <a data-rapid_p="34" href="https://developer.yahoo.com/hadoop/tutorial/module3.html">Module 3</a>. If you have

  <h3>MapReduce Basics</h3>

  <a data-rapid_p="36" name="functional"></a>
  <h4 class="sectionSubH">Functional Programming Concepts</h4>

  <p>MapReduce programs are designed to compute large volumes of
  data in a parallel fashion. This requires dividing the workload
  across a large number of machines. This model would not scale
  to large clusters (hundreds or thousands of nodes) if the
  components were allowed to share data arbitrarily. The communication
  overhead required to keep the data on the nodes synchronized
  at all times would prevent the system from performing reliably
  or efficiently at large scale.</p>

  <p>Instead, all data elements in MapReduce are <i>immutable</i>,
  meaning that they cannot be updated. If in a mapping task you change
  an input (key, value) pair, it does not get reflected back in the
  input files; communication occurs only by generating new output
  (key, value) pairs which are then forwarded by the Hadoop system
  into the next phase of execution.</p>

  <a data-rapid_p="37" name="lists"></a>
  <h4 class="sectionSubH">List Processing</h4>

  <p>Conceptually, MapReduce programs transform lists of input
  data elements into lists of output data elements. A MapReduce
  program will do this twice, using two different list processing
  idioms: <i>map</i>, and <i>reduce</i>. These terms are taken
  from several list processing languages such as LISP, Scheme,
  or ML.</p>

  <a data-rapid_p="38" name="listmapping"></a>
  <h4 class="sectionSubH">Mapping Lists</h4>

  <p>The first phase of a MapReduce program is called <i>mapping</i>.
  A list of data elements are provided, one at a time, to a
  function called the <i>Mapper</i>, which transforms each element
  individually to an output data element. </p>

  <div style="text-align: center">

    <img src="Hadoop%20Tutorial%20-%20YDN_files/3529146569_f80eb39a44_o.png" alt="map">
    <p>Figure 4.1: Mapping creates a new output list by applying a
    function to individual elements of an input list.</p>
  </div>

  <p>As an example of the utility of map: Suppose you had a
  function <tt>toUpper(str)</tt> which returns an uppercase version
  of its input string. You could use this function with <tt>map</tt>
  to turn a list of strings into a list of uppercase strings.
  Note that we are not <i>modifying</i> the input string here:
  we are returning a new string that will form part of a new
  output list.</p>

  <a data-rapid_p="39" name="listreducing"></a>
  <h4 class="sectionSubH">Reducing Lists</h4>

  <p>Reducing lets you aggregate values together. A <i>reducer</i>
  function receives an iterator of input values from an input
  list. It then combines these values together, returning a
  single output value. </p>

  <div style="text-align: center">

    <img src="Hadoop%20Tutorial%20-%20YDN_files/3529959720_273aca53fe_o.png" alt="reduce">
    <p><i>Figure 4.2: Reducing a list iterates over the input
    values to produce an aggregate value as output.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>Reducing is often used to produce "summary"
  data, turning a large volume of data into a smaller summary
  of itself. For example, "+" can be used as a
  reducing function, to return the sum of a list of input
  values.</p>

  <a data-rapid_p="40" name="together"></a>
  <h4 class="sectionSubH">Putting Them Together in MapReduce:</h4>

  <p>The Hadoop MapReduce framework takes these concepts and
  uses them to process large volumes of information. A
  MapReduce program has two components: one that implements
  the mapper, and another that implements the reducer. The
  Mapper and Reducer idioms described above are extended
  slightly to work in this environment, but the basic
  principles are the same.</p>

  <p><b>Keys and values:</b> In MapReduce, no value stands
  on its own. Every value has a <i>key</i> associated with it.
  Keys identify related values. For example, a log of
  time-coded speedometer readings from multiple cars could be
  keyed by license-plate number; it would look like:
  </p><pre class="codeblue"><tt>

AAA-123   65mph, 12:00pm
ZZZ-789   50mph, 12:02pm
AAA-123   40mph, 12:05pm
CCC-456   25mph, 12:15pm
...</tt></pre>
  <p></p>

  <p>The mapping and reducing functions receive not just
  values, but (key, value) pairs. The output of each of
  these functions is the same: both a key and a value must
  be emitted to the next list in the data flow.</p>

  <p>MapReduce is also less strict than other languages about
  how the Mapper and Reducer work. In more formal functional
  mapping and reducing settings, a mapper must produce exactly
  one output element for each input element, and a reducer must
  produce exactly one output element for each input list.
  In MapReduce, an arbitrary number of values can be output
  from each phase; a mapper may map one input into zero, one,
  or one hundred outputs. A reducer may compute over an input list
  and emit one or a dozen different outputs.</p>

  <p><b>Keys divide the reduce space:</b> A reducing function
  turns a large list of values into one (or a few) output
  values. In MapReduce, all of the output values are not
  usually reduced together. All of the values <i>with the same
  key</i> are presented to a single reducer together. This
  is performed independently of any reduce operations occurring
  on other lists of values, with different keys attached.</p>

  <div style="text-align: center">
    <img src="Hadoop%20Tutorial%20-%20YDN_files/3529959740_6756f2f531_o.png" alt="reduce-keys">
    <p><i>Figure 4.3: Different colors represent different keys.
    All values with the same key are presented to a single
    reduce task.</i></p>
  </div>

  <a data-rapid_p="41" name="wordcount"></a>
  <h4 class="sectionSubH">An Example Application: Word Count</h4>

  <p>A simple MapReduce program can be written to determine
  how many times different words appear in a set of files.
  For example, if we had the files:</p>

  <p><b>foo.txt:</b> Sweet, this is the foo file</p>
  <p><b>bar.txt:</b> This is the bar file</p>

  <p>We would expect the output to be:</p>

  <p>
</p><pre class="codeblue">sweet 1
this  2
is    2
the   2
foo   1
bar   1
file  2
</pre><p></p>

  <p>Naturally, we can write a program in MapReduce to compute
  this output. The high-level structure would look like this:</p>

  <div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">mapper (filename, file-contents):
  <b>for each</b> word <b>in</b> file-contents:
    <b>emit</b> (word, 1)

reducer (word, values):
  sum = 0
  <b>for each</b> value <b>in</b> values:
    sum = sum + value
  <b>emit</b> (word, sum)</pre></div>

  <p><i>Listing 4.1: High-Level MapReduce Word Count</i></p>

  <p>Several instances of the mapper function are created on
  the different machines in our cluster. Each instance receives
  a different input file (it is assumed that we have many such
  files). The mappers output (word, 1) pairs which are then
  forwarded to the reducers. Several instances of the reducer
  method are also instantiated on the different machines. Each
  reducer is responsible for processing the list of values
  associated with a different word. The list of values will
  be a list of 1's; the reducer sums up those ones into a
  final count associated with a single word. The reducer then
  emits the final (word, count) output which is written to
  an output file.</p>


  <p>We can write a very similar program to this in Hadoop
  MapReduce; it is included in the Hadoop distribution in
  <tt>src/examples/org/apache/hadoop/examples/WordCount.java</tt>.
  It is partially reproduced below:

  </p><div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">  public static class MapClass extends MapReduceBase
    implements Mapper&lt;LongWritable, Text, Text, IntWritable&gt; {

    private final static IntWritable one = new IntWritable(1);
    private Text word = new Text();

    public void map(LongWritable key, Text value,
                    OutputCollector&lt;Text, IntWritable&gt; output,
                    Reporter reporter) throws IOException {
      String line = value.toString();
      StringTokenizer itr = new StringTokenizer(line);
      while (itr.hasMoreTokens()) {
        word.set(itr.nextToken());
        output.collect(word, one);
      }
    }
  }

  /**
   * A reducer class that just emits the sum of the input values.
   */
  public static class Reduce extends MapReduceBase
    implements Reducer&lt;Text, IntWritable, Text, IntWritable&gt; {

    public void reduce(Text key, Iterator&lt;IntWritable&gt; values,
                       OutputCollector&lt;Text, IntWritable&gt; output,
                       Reporter reporter) throws IOException {
      int sum = 0;
      while (values.hasNext()) {
        sum += values.next().get();
      }
      output.collect(key, new IntWritable(sum));
    }
  }</pre></div>

  <p><i>Listing 4.2: Hadoop MapReduce Word Count Source</i></p>

  <p>There are some minor differences between this actual Java
  implementation and the pseudo-code shown above. First,
  Java has no native <tt>emit</tt> keyword; the <tt>OutputCollector</tt>
  object you are given as an input will receive values to
  emit to the next stage of execution. And second, the default input
  format used by Hadoop presents each line of an input file
  as a separate input to the mapper function, not the entire file
  at a time. It also uses a <tt>StringTokenizer</tt> object
  to break up the line into words. This does not perform any
  normalization of the input, so "cat", "Cat"

  and "cat," are all regarded as different strings.
  Note that the class-variable <tt>word</tt> is reused each time the mapper
  outputs another (word, 1) pairing; this saves time by not
  allocating a new variable for each output. The <tt>output.collect()</tt>
  method will copy the values it receives as input, so you
  are free to overwrite the variables you use.</p>

  <a data-rapid_p="42" name="driver"></a>
  <h4 class="sectionSubH">The Driver Method</h4>

  <p>There is one final component of a Hadoop MapReduce program,
  called the <i>Driver</i>. The driver initializes the job and
  instructs the Hadoop platform to execute your code on a set
  of input files, and controls where the output files are placed.
  A cleaned-up version of the driver from the example Java implementation
  that comes with Hadoop is presented below:</p>

  <div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">  public void run(String inputPath, String outputPath) throws Exception {
    JobConf conf = new JobConf(WordCount.class);
    conf.setJobName("wordcount");

    // the keys are words (strings)
    conf.setOutputKeyClass(Text.class);
    // the values are counts (ints)
    conf.setOutputValueClass(IntWritable.class);

    conf.setMapperClass(MapClass.class);
    conf.setReducerClass(Reduce.class);

    FileInputFormat.addInputPath(conf, new Path(inputPath));
    FileOutputFormat.setOutputPath(conf, new Path(outputPath));

    JobClient.runJob(conf);
  }</pre></div>
  <p><i>Listing 4.3: Hadoop MapReduce Word Count Driver</i></p>

  <p>This method sets up a job to execute the word count program
  across all the files in a given input directory (the <tt>inputPath</tt>

  argument). The output from the reducers are written into files
  in the directory identified by <tt>outputPath</tt>. The configuration
  information to run the job is captured in the <i>JobConf</i>
  object. The mapping and reducing functions are identified by the
  <tt>setMapperClass()</tt> and <tt>setReducerClass()</tt> methods.
  The data types emitted by the reducer are identified by
  <tt>setOutputKeyClass()</tt> and <tt>setOutputValueClass()</tt>.
  By default, it is assumed that these are the output types of
  the mapper as well. If this is not the case, the methods
  <tt>setMapOutputKeyClass()</tt> and <tt>setMapOutputValueClass()</tt>

  methods of the <tt>JobConf</tt> class will override these.
  The input types fed to the mapper
  are controlled by the <i>InputFormat</i> used. Input formats
  are <a data-rapid_p="43" href="#inputformat">discussed in more detail</a>
  below. The
  default input format, "TextInputFormat," will
  load data in as (<i>LongWritable, Text</i>) pairs. The
  long value is the byte offset of the line in the file. The Text
  object holds the string contents of the line of the file.</p>


  <p>The call to <tt>JobClient.runJob(conf)</tt> will submit the
  job to MapReduce. This call will block until the job completes.
  If the job fails, it will throw an IOException. JobClient
  also provides a non-blocking version called <tt>submitJob()</tt>.
  </p>

  <a data-rapid_p="44" name="dataflow"></a>
  <h3>MapReduce Data Flow</h3>

  <p>Now that we have seen the components that make up a basic
  MapReduce job, we can see how everything works together at a
  higher level:</p>

  <div style="text-align: center">
    <img src="Hadoop%20Tutorial%20-%20YDN_files/3529146657_5b5d025a5f_o.png" alt="mapreduce-process">
    <p><i>Figure 4.4: High-level MapReduce pipeline</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>MapReduce inputs typically come from input files loaded onto
  our processing cluster in <a data-rapid_p="45" href="https://developer.yahoo.com/hadoop/tutorial/module2.html">HDFS</a>. These
  files are evenly distributed across all our nodes. Running a
  MapReduce program involves running mapping tasks on many or all
  of the nodes in our cluster. Each of these mapping tasks is
  equivalent: no mappers have particular "identities"

  associated with them. Therefore, any mapper can process any
  input file. Each mapper loads the set of files local to that
  machine and processes them.</p>

  <p>When the mapping phase has completed, the intermediate
  (key, value) pairs must be exchanged between machines to send all
  values with the same key to a single reducer. The reduce tasks
  are spread across the same nodes in the cluster as the mappers.
  <b>This is the only communication step in MapReduce.</b> Individual
  map tasks do not exchange information with one another, nor are
  they aware of one another's existence. Similarly, different
  reduce tasks do not communicate with one another. The user never
  explicitly marshals information from one machine to another; all
  data transfer is handled by the Hadoop MapReduce platform itself,
  guided implicitly by the different keys associated with values.
  This is a fundamental element of Hadoop MapReduce's reliability.
  If nodes in the cluster fail, tasks must be able to be restarted.
  If they have been performing <i>side-effects</i>, e.g., communicating
  with the outside world, then the shared state must be restored
  in a restarted task. By eliminating communication and side-effects,
  restarts can be handled more gracefully.
  </p>


  <a data-rapid_p="46" name="closer"></a>
  <h4 class="sectionSubH">A Closer Look</h4>

  <p>The previous figure described the high-level view of Hadoop MapReduce.
  From this diagram, you can see where the mapper and reducer components
  of the Word Count application fit in, and how it achieves its objective.
  We will now examine this system in a bit closer detail.</p>

  <div style="text-align: center">
    <img src="Hadoop%20Tutorial%20-%20YDN_files/3529146683_c8247ff6db_o.png" alt="mapreduce-flow">
    <p><i>Figure 4.5: Detailed Hadoop MapReduce data flow</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>Figure 4.5 shows the pipeline with more of its mechanics exposed. While
  only two nodes are depicted, the same pipeline can be replicated across
  a very large number of nodes.
  The next several paragraphs describe each of the stages of a MapReduce program
  more precisely.</p>

  <p><b>Input files:</b> This is where the data for a MapReduce task is
  initially stored. While this does not need to be the case, the input files
  typically reside in HDFS.  The format of these files is arbitrary; while
  line-based log files can be used, we could also use a binary format,
  multi-line input records, or something else entirely. It is typical for these
  input files to be very large -- tens of gigabytes or more.</p>

  <a data-rapid_p="47" name="inputformat"></a>
  <p><b>InputFormat:</b> How these input files are split up and read is defined
  by the InputFormat. An InputFormat is a class that provides the following
  functionality:
  </p>

  <ul>

  <li class="bullist">Selects the files or other objects that should be used for input</li>
  <li class="bullist">Defines the <i>InputSplits</i> that break a file into tasks</li>
  <li class="bullist">Provides a factory for <i>RecordReader</i> objects that read the file</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Several InputFormats are provided with Hadoop. An abstract type is
  called <i>FileInputFormat</i>; all InputFormats that operate on files inherit
  functionality and properties from this class. When starting a Hadoop
  job, FileInputFormat is provided with a path containing files to read. The
  FileInputFormat will read all files in this directory. It then divides these
  files into one or more InputSplits each.  You can choose which
  InputFormat to apply to your input files for a job by calling the
  <tt>setInputFormat()</tt> method of the <i>JobConf</i> object that
  defines the job. A table of standard InputFormats is given below.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <table>

    <tbody><tr><th>InputFormat:</th><th>Description:</th><th>Key:</th><th>Value:</th></tr>
    <tr><td>TextInputFormat</td><td>Default format; reads lines of text
        files</td><td>The byte offset of the line</td><td>The line
        contents</td></tr>
    <tr><td>KeyValueInputFormat</td><td>Parses lines into key, val pairs</td>
        <td>Everything up to the first tab character</td><td>The remainder of
        the line</td></tr>

    <tr><td>SequenceFileInputFormat</td><td>A Hadoop-specific high-performance
        binary format</td><td>user-defined</td><td>user-defined</td></tr><tr>
    </tr></tbody></table>
    <p>Table 4.1: InputFormats provided by MapReduce</p>
  </div>

  <p>The default InputFormat is the <i>TextInputFormat</i>. This treats each
  line of each input file as a separate record, and performs no parsing. This
  is useful for unformatted data or line-based records like log files. A more
  interesting input format is the <i>KeyValueInputFormat</i>. This format
  also treats each line of input as a separate record. While the TextInputFormat
  treats the entire line as the value, the KeyValueInputFormat breaks the line
  itself into the key and value by searching for a tab character. This is
  particularly useful for reading the output of one MapReduce job as the
  input to another, as the default OutputFormat (described in more detail
  below) formats its results in this manner. Finally, the
  <i>SequenceFileInputFormat</i> reads special binary files that are specific
  to Hadoop. These files include many features designed to allow data to be
  rapidly read into Hadoop mappers. Sequence files are block-compressed
  and provide direct serialization and deserialization of several
  arbitrary data types (not just text). Sequence files can be generated as
  the output of other MapReduce tasks and are an efficient intermediate
  representation for data that is passing from one MapReduce job to
  anther.</p>

  <p><b>InputSplits:</b> An InputSplit describes a unit of work that comprises
  a single <i>map task</i> in a MapReduce program. A MapReduce program applied
  to a data set, collectively referred to as a <i>Job</i>, is made up of several
  (possibly several hundred) tasks. Map tasks may involve reading a whole file;
  they often involve reading only part of a file. By default, the
  FileInputFormat and its descendants break a file up into 64 MB chunks (the
  same size as blocks in HDFS). You can control this value by setting the
  <tt>mapred.min.split.size</tt> parameter in <tt>hadoop-site.xml</tt>, or
  by overriding the parameter in the <tt>JobConf</tt> object used to
  submit a particular MapReduce job. By
  processing a file in chunks, we allow several map tasks to operate on a single
  file in parallel. If the file is very large, this can improve performance
  significantly through parallelism. Even more importantly, since the various
  blocks that make up the file may be spread across several different nodes
  in the cluster, it allows tasks to be scheduled on each of these different
  nodes; the individual blocks are thus all processed locally, instead of
  needing to be transferred from one node to another. Of course, while log
  files can be processed in this piece-wise fashion, some file formats are
  not amenable to chunked processing. By writing a custom InputFormat, you can
  control how the file is broken up (or is not broken up) into splits.
  Custom input formats are described in <a data-rapid_p="48" href="https://developer.yahoo.com/hadoop/tutorial/module5.html">Module 5</a>.
  </p>

  <p>The InputFormat defines the list of tasks that make up the mapping
  phase; each task corresponds to a single input split. The tasks are then
  assigned to the nodes in the system based on where the input file
  chunks are physically resident. An individual node may have several
  dozen tasks assigned to it. The node will begin working on the tasks,
  attempting to perform as many in parallel as it can. The on-node parallelism
  is controlled by the <tt>mapred.tasktracker.map.tasks.maximum</tt>
  parameter.</p>

  <p><b>RecordReader:</b> The InputSplit has defined a slice of work,
  but does not describe how to access it. The <i>RecordReader</i> class
  actually loads the data from its source and converts it into (key,
  value) pairs suitable for reading by the Mapper. The RecordReader
  instance is defined by the InputFormat. The default InputFormat,
  <i>TextInputFormat</i>, provides a <i>LineRecordReader</i>, which
  treats each line of the input file as a new value. The key associated
  with each line is its byte offset in the file. The RecordReader is
  invoke repeatedly on the input until the entire InputSplit has been
  consumed. Each invocation of the RecordReader leads to another
  call to the <tt>map()</tt> method of the Mapper.</p>


  <p><b>Mapper:</b> The Mapper performs the interesting user-defined
  work of the first phase of the MapReduce program. Given a key and
  a value, the <tt>map()</tt> method emits (key, value) pair(s)
  which are forwarded to the Reducers. A new instance of Mapper is
  instantiated in a separate Java process for each map task (InputSplit)
  that makes up part of the total job input. The individual mappers
  are intentionally not provided with a mechanism to communicate with one
  another in any way. This allows the reliability of each map task to be
  governed solely by the reliability of the local machine. The
  <tt>map()</tt> method receives two parameters in addition to the
  key and the value:</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="bullist">The <i>OutputCollector</i> object has a method named <tt>collect()</tt>

    which will forward a (key, value) pair to the reduce phase of the job.
    </li>
    <li class="bullist">
    The <i>Reporter</i> object provides information about the current
    task; its <tt>getInputSplit()</tt> method will return an object
    describing the current InputSplit. It also allows the map task to
    provide additional information about its progress to the rest of
    the system. The <tt>setStatus()</tt> method allows you to emit
    a status message back to the user. The <tt>incrCounter()</tt>

    method allows you to increment shared performance counters. You
    may define as many arbitrary counters as you wish. Each mapper can
    increment the counters, and the JobTracker will collect the
    increments made by the different processes and aggregate them for
    later retrieval when the job ends.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>Partition &amp; Shuffle:</b> After the first map tasks have completed,
  the nodes may still be performing several more map tasks each.
  But they also begin exchanging
  the intermediate outputs from the map tasks to where they are required
  by the reducers. This process of moving map outputs to the reducers
  is known as <i>shuffling</i>. A different subset of the intermediate
  key space is assigned to each reduce node; these subsets (known as
  "partitions") are the inputs to the reduce tasks.
  Each map task may emit (key, value) pairs to any partition; all
  values for the same key are always reduced together regardless of
  which mapper is its origin. Therefore, the map nodes must all agree
  on where to send the different pieces of the intermediate data.
  The <i>Partitioner</i> class determines which partition a given
  (key, value) pair will go to. The default partitioner computes a
  hash value for the key and assigns the partition based on this
  result. Custom partitioners are described in more detail in
  <a data-rapid_p="49" href="https://developer.yahoo.com/hadoop/tutorial/module5.html">Module 5</a>.
  </p>

  <p><b>Sort:</b> Each reduce task is responsible for reducing
  the values associated with several intermediate keys. The set of
  intermediate keys on a single node is automatically sorted by
  Hadoop before they are presented to the Reducer.
  </p>

  <p><b>Reduce:</b> A Reducer instance is created for each reduce
  task. This is an instance of user-provided code that performs
  the second important phase of job-specific work. For each key
  in the partition assigned to a Reducer, the Reducer's
  <tt>reduce()</tt> method is called once. This receives a key
  as well as an iterator over all the values associated with the
  key. The values associated with a key are returned by the
  iterator in an undefined order. The Reducer also receives
  as parameters <i>OutputCollector</i> and <i>Reporter</i> objects;
  they are used in the same manner as in the <tt>map()</tt> method.</p>

  <p><b>OutputFormat:</b> The (key, value) pairs provided to this
  OutputCollector are then written to output files. The way they
  are written is governed by the <i>OutputFormat</i>. The OutputFormat
  functions much like the InputFormat class described earlier.
  The instances of OutputFormat provided by Hadoop write to
  files on the local disk or in HDFS; they all inherit from a
  common <i>FileOutputFormat</i>. Each Reducer writes a separate
  file in a common output directory. These files will typically
  be named <tt>part-<i>nnnnn</i></tt>, where <i>nnnnn</i> is the
  partition id associated with the reduce task.
  The output directory is set by the
  <tt>FileOutputFormat.setOutputPath()</tt> method.
  You can control which particular OutputFormat is used by calling
  the <tt>setOutputFormat()</tt> method of the <i>JobConf</i>

  object that defines your MapReduce job. A table of
  provided OutputFormats is given below.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <table>
      <tbody><tr><th>OutputFormat:</th><th>Description</th></tr>
      <tr><td>TextOutputFormat</td><td>Default; writes lines in "key \t
          value" form</td></tr>

      <tr><td>SequenceFileOutputFormat</td><td>Writes binary files
          suitable for reading into subsequent MapReduce jobs</td></tr>
      <tr><td>NullOutputFormat</td><td>Disregards its inputs</td></tr>
    </tbody></table>
    <p>Table 4.2: OutputFormats provided by Hadoop</p>
  </div>

  <p>Hadoop provides some OutputFormat instances to write to files. The
  basic (default) instance is TextOutputFormat, which writes (key, value)
  pairs on individual lines of a text file. This can be easily re-read by
  a later MapReduce task using the <i>KeyValueInputFormat</i> class, and
  is also human-readable. A better intermediate format for use between MapReduce
  jobs is the <i>SequenceFileOutputFormat</i> which rapidly serializes
  arbitrary data types to the file; the corresponding
  <i>SequenceFileInputFormat</i> will deserialize the file into the same
  types and presents the data to the next Mapper in the same manner as
  it was emitted by the previous Reducer. The <i>NullOutputFormat</i>

  generates no output files and disregards any (key, value) pairs
  passed to it by the OutputCollector. This is useful if you are
  explicitly writing your own output files in the <tt>reduce()</tt>
  method, and do not want additional empty output files generated
  by the Hadoop framework.</p>

  <p><b>RecordWriter:</b> Much like how the InputFormat actually reads
  individual records through the RecordReader implementation, the
  OutputFormat class is a factory for <i>RecordWriter</i> objects;
  these are used to write the individual records to the files
  as directed by the OutputFormat.</p>

  <p>The <b>output files</b> written by the Reducers are then left
  in HDFS for your use, either by another MapReduce job, a separate
  program, for for human inspection.</p>

  <h4 class="sectionSubH">Additional MapReduce Functionality</h4>

  <div style="text-align: center">
    <img src="Hadoop%20Tutorial%20-%20YDN_files/3529959828_0b689d1d5c_o.png" alt="combiner-flow">

    <p><i>Figure 4.6: Combiner step inserted into the MapReduce data
    flow</i></p>
  </div>

  <p><b>Combiner:</b> The pipeline showed earlier omits a processing
  step which can be used for optimizing bandwidth usage by your MapReduce
  job. Called the <i>Combiner,</i> this pass runs after the Mapper and
  before the Reducer. Usage of the Combiner is optional. If this pass
  is suitable for your job, instances of the Combiner class are run
  on every node that has run map tasks. The Combiner will receive as
  input all data emitted by the Mapper instances on a given node. The
  output from the Combiner is then sent to the Reducers, instead of
  the output from the Mappers. The Combiner is <b>a "mini-reduce"
  process which operates only on data generated by one machine.</b></p>

  <p>Word count is a prime example for where a Combiner is useful. The
  Word Count program in listings 1--3 emits a <tt>(<i>word</i>, 1)</tt>
  pair for every instance of every word it sees. So if the same document
  contains the word "cat" 3 times, the pair <tt>("cat",
  1)</tt> is emitted three times; all of these are then sent to the Reducer.
  By using a Combiner, these can be condensed into a single
  <tt>("cat", 3)</tt> pair to be sent to the Reducer. Now each
  node only sends a single value to the reducer for each word -- drastically
  reducing the total bandwidth required for the shuffle process, and speeding
  up the job. The best part of all is that we do not need to write any
  additional code to take advantage of this! If a reduce function is both
  <i>commutative</i> and <i>associative</i>, then it can be used as a Combiner
  as well. You can enable combining in the word count program by adding the
  following line to the driver:

  </p><div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">
conf.setCombinerClass(Reduce.class);</pre></div>

  <p>The Combiner should be an instance of the <i>Reducer</i> interface.
  If your Reducer itself cannot be used directly as a Combiner because of
  commutativity or associativity, you might still
  be able to write a third class to use as a Combiner for your job.</p>

  <a data-rapid_p="51" name="tolerence"></a>
  <h4 class="sectionSubH">Fault Tolerance</h4>

  <p>One of the primary reasons to use Hadoop to run your jobs is due to
  its high degree of fault tolerance. Even when running jobs on a large
  cluster where individual nodes or network components may experience
  high rates of failure, Hadoop can guide jobs toward a successful
  completion.</p>

  <p>The primary way that Hadoop achieves fault tolerance is through
  restarting tasks. Individual task nodes (<i>TaskTrackers</i>) are
  in constant communication
  with the head node of the system, called the <i>JobTracker</i>. If
  a TaskTracker fails to communicate with the JobTracker for a period
  of time (by default, 1 minute), the JobTracker will assume that the
  TaskTracker in question has crashed. The JobTracker knows which
  map and reduce tasks were assigned to each TaskTracker.</p>

  <p>If the job is still in the mapping phase, then other TaskTrackers
  will be asked to re-execute all map tasks previously run by the
  failed TaskTracker. If the job is in the reducing phase, then
  other TaskTrackers will re-execute all reduce tasks that were
  in progress on the failed TaskTracker.</p>

  <p>Reduce tasks, once completed, have been written back to HDFS. Thus,
  if a TaskTracker has already completed two out of three reduce tasks
  assigned to it, only the third task must be executed elsewhere. Map
  tasks are slightly more complicated: even if a node has completed
  ten map tasks, the reducers may not have all copied their inputs from
  the output of those map tasks. If a node has crashed, then its mapper
  outputs are inaccessible. So any already-completed map tasks must
  be re-executed to make their results available to the rest of the
  reducing machines. All of this is handled automatically by the
  Hadoop platform.</p>

  <p>This fault tolerance underscores the need for program execution
  to be side-effect free. If Mappers and Reducers had individual
  identities and communicated with one another or the outside world,
  then restarting a task would require the other nodes to communicate
  with the new instances of the map and reduce tasks, and the re-executed
  tasks would need to reestablish their intermediate state. This process
  is notoriously complicated and error-prone in the general case.
  MapReduce simplifies this problem drastically by eliminating
  task identities or the ability for task partitions to communicate
  with one another. An individual task sees only its own direct
  inputs and knows only its own outputs, to make this failure and
  restart process clean and dependable. </p>


  <p><b>Speculative execution:</b> One problem with the Hadoop system is
  that by dividing the tasks across many nodes, it is possible for a
  few slow nodes to rate-limit the rest of the program. For example if
  one node has a slow disk controller, then it may be reading its input
  at only 10% the speed of all the other nodes. So when 99 map tasks
  are already complete, the system is still waiting for the final
  map task to check in, which takes much longer than all the other nodes.
  </p>

  <p>By forcing tasks to run in
  isolation from one another, individual tasks do not know <i>where</i>
  their inputs come from. Tasks trust the Hadoop platform to just
  deliver the appropriate input.  Therefore, the same input can be
  processed <i>multiple times in parallel</i>, to exploit differences
  in machine capabilities. As most of the tasks in a job are coming to
  a close, the Hadoop platform will schedule redundant copies of the
  remaining tasks across several nodes which do not have other work
  to perform. This process is known as <i>speculative execution</i>.
  When tasks complete, they announce this fact to the JobTracker.
  Whichever copy of a task finishes first becomes the definitive
  copy. If other copies were executing speculatively, Hadoop
  tells the TaskTrackers to abandon the tasks and discard their
  outputs. The Reducers then receive their inputs from whichever
  Mapper completed successfully, first.</p>

  <p>Speculative execution is enabled by default. You can disable
  speculative execution for the mappers and reducers by setting
  the <tt>mapred.map.tasks.speculative.execution</tt> and
  <tt>mapred.reduce.tasks.speculative.execution</tt> JobConf
  options to <tt>false</tt>, respectively.</p>

  <a data-rapid_p="52" name="checkpoint"></a>
  <h3>Checkpoint</h3>

  <p>You now know about all of the basic operations of the
  Hadoop MapReduce platform. Try the following exercise, to see if you
  understand the MapReduce programming concepts.
  </p>

  <p><b>Exercise:</b> Given the code for WordCount in listings 2 and 3,
  modify this code to produce an <i>inverted index</i> of its inputs.
  An inverted index returns a list of documents that contain each word
  in those documents. Thus, if the word "cat" appears in
  documents A and B, but not C, then the line:</p>

  <div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">cat    A, B</pre></div>

  <p>should appear in the output. If the word "baseball" appears
  in documents B and C, then the line:</p>

  <div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">baseball    B, C</pre></div>

  <p>should appear in the output as well.</p>

  <p>If you get stuck, read the section on <a data-rapid_p="53" href="#troubleshooting">troubleshooting</a> below. The working solution
  is provided at the end of this module.</p>

  <p><b>Hint:</b> The default InputFormat will provide the Mapper with
  (key, value) pairs where the key is the byte offset into the file, and the
  value is a line of text. To get the filename of the current input, use
  the following code:</p>

  <div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">FileSplit fileSplit = (FileSplit)reporter.getInputSplit();
String fileName = fileSplit.getPath().getName();

  <h3>More Tips</h3>

  <a data-rapid_p="55" name="chaining"></a>
  <h4 class="sectionSubH">Chaining Jobs</h4>

  <p>Not every problem can be solved with a MapReduce program, but fewer
  still are those which can be solved with a single MapReduce job. Many
  problems can be solved with MapReduce, by writing several MapReduce
  steps which run in series to accomplish a goal:</p>

  <p>Map1 -&gt; Reduce1 -&gt; Map2 -&gt; Reduce2 -&gt; Map3...</p>

  <p>You can easily chain jobs together in this fashion by writing
  multiple driver methods, one for each job. Call the first driver method, which
  uses <tt>JobClient.runJob()</tt> to run the job and wait for it to
  complete. When that job has completed, then call the next driver method,
  which creates a new <tt>JobConf</tt> object referring to different instances
  of <i>Mapper</i> and <i>Reducer</i>, etc. The first job in the chain
  should write its output to a path which is then used as the input path for
  the second job. This process can be repeated for as many jobs are necessary
  to arrive at a complete solution to the problem.
  </p>

  <p>Many problems which at first seem impossible in MapReduce can be
  accomplished by dividing one job into two or more.</p>

  <p>Hadoop provides another mechanism for managing batches of jobs
  with dependencies between jobs. Rather than submit a <tt>JobConf</tt>
  to the <tt>JobClient</tt>'s <tt>runJob()</tt> or <tt>submitJob()</tt>

  methods, <tt>org.apache.hadoop.mapred.jobcontrol.Job</tt> objects
  can be created to represent each
  job; A <tt>Job</tt> takes a <tt>JobConf</tt> object as its
  constructor argument. Jobs can depend on one another through the
  use of the <tt>addDependingJob()</tt> method. The code:</p>

  <div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">
  x.addDependingJob(y)</pre></div>

  <p>says that Job <i>x</i> cannot start until <i>y</i> has successfully
  completed. Dependency information cannot be added to a job after it
  has already been started. Given a set of jobs, these can be passed to
  an instance of the  <tt>JobControl</tt> class. <tt>JobControl</tt>

  can receive individual jobs via the <tt>addJob()</tt> method, or
  a collection of jobs via <tt>addJobs()</tt>. The <tt>JobControl</tt>
  object will spawn a thread in the client to launch the jobs.
  Individual jobs will be launched when their dependencies have all
  successfully completed and when the MapReduce system as a whole
  has resources to execute the jobs. The JobControl interface allows
  you to query it to retrieve the state of individual jobs, as well
  as the list of jobs waiting, ready, running, and finished. The job
  submission process does not begin until the <tt>run()</tt> method of the
  <tt>JobControl</tt> object is called.</p>


  <a data-rapid_p="56" name="troubleshooting"></a>
  <h4 class="sectionSubH">Troubleshooting: Debugging MapReduce</h4>

  <p>When writing MapReduce programs, you will occasionally encounter
  bugs in your programs, infinite loops, etc. This section describes the
  features of MapReduce that will help you diagnose and solve these
  conditions.</p>

  <p><b>Log Files:</b> Hadoop keeps logs of important events during program
  execution. By default, these are stored in the <tt>logs/</tt> subdirectory
  of the <tt>hadoop-<i>version</i>/</tt> directory where you run Hadoop
  from. Log files are named
  <tt>hadoop-<i>username</i>-<i>service</i>-<i>hostname</i>.log</tt>. The
  most recent data is in the <tt>.log</tt> file; older logs have their date
  appended to them. The username in the log filename refers to the username
  under which Hadoop was started -- this is not necessarily the same username
  you are using to run programs. The service name refers to which of the
  several Hadoop programs are writing the log; these can be jobtracker,
  namenode, datanode, secondarynamenode, or tasktracker. All of these are
  important for debugging a whole Hadoop installation. But for individual
  programs, the tasktracker logs will be the most relevant. Any exceptions
  thrown by your program will be recorded in the tasktracker logs.</p>

  <p>The log directory will also have a subdirectory called <tt>userlogs</tt>.
  Here there is another subdirectory for every task run. Each task records
  its stdout and stderr to two files in this directory. Note that on a
  multi-node Hadoop cluster, these logs are not centrally
  aggregated -- you should check each TaskNode's <tt>logs/userlogs/</tt>
  directory for their output.</p>

  <p>Debugging in the distributed setting is complicated and requires
  logging into several machines to access log data. If possible, programs
  should be unit tested by running Hadoop locally. The default configuration
  deployed by Hadoop runs in "single instance" mode, where the
  entire MapReduce program is run in the same instance of Java as called
  <tt>JobClient.runJob()</tt>. Using a debugger like Eclipse, you can then
  set breakpoints inside the <tt>map()</tt> or <tt>reduce()</tt> methods
  to discover your bugs.</p>

  <p>In <a data-rapid_p="57" href="https://developer.yahoo.com/hadoop/tutorial/module5.html">Module 5</a>, you will learn how to use
  additional features of MapReduce to distribute auxiliary code to nodes
  in the system. This can be used to enable debug scripts which run on
  machines when tasks fail.</p>

  <a data-rapid_p="58" name="killing"></a>
  <h4 class="sectionSubH">Listing and Killing Jobs:</h4>

  <p>It is possible to submit jobs to a Hadoop cluster which malfunction
  and send themselves into infinite loops or other problematic states.
  In this case, you will want to manually kill the job you have started.</p>

  <p>The following command, run in the Hadoop installation directory on
  a Hadoop cluster, will list all the current jobs:
  </p>

  <div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">$ bin/hadoop job -list</pre></div>

  <p>This will produce output that looks something like:</p>
  <div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">1 jobs currently running
JobId   State   StartTime       UserName
job_200808111901_0001   1       1218506470390   aaron</pre></div>

  <p>You can use this job id to kill the job; the command is:</p>

  <div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">$ bin/hadoop job -kill <i>jobid</i></pre></div>

  <p>Substitute the "<tt>job_2008...</tt>" from the
  <tt>-list</tt> command for <i>jobid</i>.</p>

  <a data-rapid_p="59" name="lang"></a>
  <h3>Additional Language Support</h3>

  <p>Hadoop itself is written in Java; it thus accepts Java code natively
  for Mappers and Reducers. Hadoop also comes with two adapter layers which
  allow code written in other languages to be used in MapReduce programs.</p>

  <a data-rapid_p="60" name="pipes"></a>
  <h4 class="sectionSubH">Pipes</h4>

  <p>Pipes is a library which allows C++ source code to be used for
  Mapper and Reducer code. Applications which require high numerical
  performance may see better throughput if written in C++ and used through
  Pipes. This library is supported on 32-bit Linux installations.</p>

  <p>The include files and static libraries are present in the
  <tt>c++/Linux-i386-32/</tt> directory under your Hadoop installation.
  Your application should include <tt>include/hadoop/Pipes.hh</tt>
  and <tt>TemplateFactory.hh</tt> and link against
  <tt>lib/libhadooppies.a</tt>; with gcc, include the arguments
  <tt>-L${HADOOP_HOME}/c++/Linux-i386-32/lib -lhadooppipes</tt> to do the
  latter.</p>

  <p>Both key and value inputs to pipes programs are provided as STL
  strings (<tt>std::string</tt>). A program must still define an instance of
  <i>Mapper</i> and <i>Reducer</i>; these names have not changed. (They,
  like all other classes defined in Pipes, are in the <tt>HadoopPipes</tt>
  namespace.)
  Unlike the classes of the same names in Hadoop itself,
  the <tt>map()</tt> and <tt>reduce()</tt> functions
  take in a single argument which is a reference to an object
  of type <i>MapContext</i> and <i>ReduceContext</i>

  respectively. The most important methods contained in each of
  these context objects are:

  </p><div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">const std::string&amp; getInputKey();
const std::string&amp; getInputValue();
void emit(const std::string&amp; key, const std::string&amp; value);</pre></div>

  <p>The <i>ReduceContext</i> class also contains an additional method
  to advance the value iterator:</p>
  <div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">
bool nextValue();</pre></div>

  <p><b>Defining a Pipes Program:</b> A program to use with Pipes is
  defined by writing classes extending <i>Mapper</i> and <i>Reducer</i>.
  (And optionally, <i>Partitioner</i>; see <a data-rapid_p="61" href="https://developer.yahoo.com/hadoop/tutorial/module5.html">Module 5</a>.)
  Hadoop must then be informed which classes to use to run the job.</p>

  <p>An instance of your C++ program will be started by the Pipes
  framework in <tt>main()</tt> on each machine. This should do any (hopefully
  brief) configuration required for your task. It should then define
  a <i>Factory</i> to create Mapper and Reducer instances as necessary,
  and then run the job by calling the <tt>runTask()</tt> method.
  The simplest way to define a factory is with the following code:

  </p><div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">#include"TemplateFactory.hh"
using namespace HadoopPipes;

void main() {
  // classes are indicated to the factory via templates
  // TODO: Substitute your own class names in below.
  TemplateFactory2&lt;<i>MyMapperClass</i>, <i>MyReducerClass</i>&gt; factory();

  // do any configuration you need to do here

  // start the task
  bool result = runTask(factory);
}
  </pre></div>

  <p><b>Running a Pipes Program:</b> After a Pipes program has been
  written and compiled, it can be launched as a job with the following command:
  (Do this in your Hadoop home directory)</p>

  <div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">$ bin/hadoop pipes -input <i>inputPath</i> -output <i>outputPath</i> -program <i>path/to/pipes/program/executable</i>
  </pre></div>

  <p>This will deploy your Pipes program on all nodes and run the MapReduce
  job through it. By running <tt>bin/hadoop pipes</tt> with no options, you can
  see additional usage information which describes how to set additional
  configuration values as necessary.</p>

  <p>The Pipes API contains additional functionality to allow you to
  read settings from the JobConf, override the Partitioner class, and
  use RecordReaders in a more direct fashion for higher performance. See the
  header files in <tt>c++/Linux-i386-32/include/hadoop</tt> for more
  information.</p>

  <a data-rapid_p="62" name="streaming"></a>
  <h4 class="sectionSubH">Hadoop Streaming</h4>

  <p>Whereas Pipes is an API that provides close coupling between
  C++ application code and Hadoop, Streaming is a generic API that allows
  programs written in virtually any language to be used as Hadoop
  Mapper and Reducer implementations.</p>

  <p>The official Hadoop documentation contains
  <a data-rapid_p="63" href="http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/r0.20.2/streaming.html">a
  thorough introduction to Streaming</a>, and <a data-rapid_p="64" href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HadoopStreaming">briefer notes</a>

  on the wiki. A brief overview is presented here.</p>

  <p>Hadoop Streaming allows you to use arbitrary programs for the Mapper
  and Reducer phases of a MapReduce job. Both Mappers and Reducers receive
  their input on stdin and emit output (key, value) pairs on stdout.</p>

  <p>Input and output are always represented textually in Streaming. The
  input (key, value) pairs are written to stdin for a Mapper or Reducer,
  with a 'tab' character separating the key from the value. The
  Streaming programs should split the input on the first tab character
  on the line to recover the key and the value. Streaming programs write
  their output to stdout in the same format: <tt>key \t value \n</tt>.</p>

  <p>The inputs to the reducer are sorted so that while each line contains
  only a single (key, value) pair, all the values for the same key are
  adjacent to one another.</p>

  <p>Provided it can handle its input in the text format described above,
  any Linux program or tool can be used as the mapper or reducer in
  Streaming. You can also write your own scripts in bash, python, perl,
  or another language of your choice, provided that the necessary interpreter
  is present on all nodes in your cluster.</p>

  <p><b>Running a Streaming Job:</b> To run a job with Hadoop Streaming,
  use the following command:</p>

  <div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">$ bin/hadoop jar contrib/streaming/hadoop-<i>version</i>-streaming.jar
  </pre></div>

  <p>The command as shown, with no arguments, will print some usage information.
  An example of how to run real commands is given below:</p>

  <div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">$ bin/hadoop jar contrib/streaming-hadoop-0.18.0-streaming.jar -mapper \
    <i>myMapProgram</i> -reducer <i>myReduceProgram</i> -input /some/dfs/path \
    -output /some/other/dfs/path</pre></div>

  <p>This assumes that <i>myMapProgram</i> and <i>myReduceProgram</i> are
  present on all nodes in the system ahead of time. If this is not the
  case, but they are present on the node launching the job, then they can
  be "shipped" to the other nodes with the <tt>-file</tt> option:
  </p>

  <div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">$ bin/hadoop jar contrib/streaming-hadoop-0.18.0-streaming.jar -mapper \
    <i>myMapProgram</i> -reducer <i>myReduceProgram</i> -file \
    <i>myMapProgram</i> -file <i>myReduceProgram</i> -input some/dfs/path \
    -output some/other/dfs/path</pre></div>

  <p>Any other support files necessary to run your program can be shipped
  in this manner as well.</p>

  <a data-rapid_p="65" name="conclusions"></a>
  <h3>Conclusions</h3>

  <p>This module described the MapReduce execution platform at the heart of
  the Hadoop system. By using MapReduce, a high degree of parallelism can
  be achieved by applications. The MapReduce framework provides a high
  degree of fault tolerance for applications running on it by limiting the
  communication which can occur between nodes, and requiring applications
  to be written in a "dataflow-centric" manner.</p>
